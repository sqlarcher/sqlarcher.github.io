## SQLArcher

I am a solution architect with over 15 years in the industry, and I write about interesting implementations or other noteworthy tips and tricks as it relates to technology platforms within the data engineering and data analytics space.

My focus is primarily on Databricks, Microsoft Fabric, and the supporting hyperscaler configurations required to operate either.
